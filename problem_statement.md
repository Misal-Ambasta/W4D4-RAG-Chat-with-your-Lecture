# Lecture Chat Application Requirements

## Project Overview

**Q: 2 - Chat with your Lecture**

Create an application that processes 2-3 hour lecture videos, generates transcripts, and enables natural language conversations with the lecture content using RAG architecture. Students can upload videos and chat with the material for better learning.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- Video upload functionality for lecture recordings
- Automated transcript generation from video and audio
- RAG pipeline for transcript processing and chunking
- An interactive chat interface with lecture content
- Timestamp-based responses linking back to video moments
- Context-aware Q&A system

## Technical Implementation

### Core RAG Pipeline for Lectures

1. **Video upload and audio extraction**
2. **Speech-to-text transcription** (Whisper/OpenAI)
3. **Transcript chunking** with timestamp preservation
4. **Vector embedding storage**
5. **Retrieval mechanism** for relevant lecture segments
6. **Response generation** with video timestamp references

## Sample Use Cases

- "What did the professor say about machine learning algorithms?"
- "Explain the concept discussed around minute 45"
- "Summarize the key points from the first hour"
- "What examples were given for neural networks?"

## Deliverables

1. **Complete lecture intelligence application** with video upload and chat interface
2. **RAG pipeline** with timestamp-aware retrieval
3. **Technical documentation** of video processing and chunking strategies
4. **Demo** with sample lecture videos
